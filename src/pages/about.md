I started programming in scratch in primary school (at the age of 9) and then, 2 years later, started programming in Python, which has been my go-to programming language ever since.
I have then started using other languages: (in order of first program as I remember it) HTML and CSS, Arduino, C, C++, javascript, lua, and some others I have not done so much with, like bash, go, haskell and rust.

I am now in high school in Paris and make little projects that, most of the time, are just for my personal use.

All my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/tarneaux" target="_blank">github</a>.
