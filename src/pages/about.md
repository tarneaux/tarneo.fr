I started programming in scratch in primary school (at the age of 9) and then, 2 years later, started programming in Python, which has been my go-to programming language for a few years. I have then started using other languages, first HTML and CSS, then Arduino, C, C++, javascript, lua, and some others I have not done so much with, like bash, go, and haskell. I now prioritize rust for its safety.

I am now in high school in Paris and make little projects that, most of the time, are just for my personal use.

All my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/tarneaux" target="_blank">github</a>.

One project I really enjoyed making is my split keyboard, the <a href="https://github.com/tarneaux/supersplit" target="_blank">supersplit<a>.
