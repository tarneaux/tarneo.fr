## Addresses, accounts and JID

Feel free to contact me through any of the means listed below.

**email**: tarneo@tarneo.fr\
**XMPP**: [tarneo@renn.es](xmpp:tarneo@renn.es?omemo-sid-777090665=e44cec2d4c97dd5df58f20d0baca5799bdcfe3d745608aad0ba7b24c1d11af17)\

**github**: [tarneaux](https://github.com/tarneaux)

You don't need to be very polite. I adhere to [Crocker's rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html).

If you send me an email and know how to use PGP encryption, please encrypt it with the key below.

## PGP

To download my PGP key automatically with GnuPG:
```sh
gpg --locate-keys tarneo@tarneo.fr
```

You can also [download](/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/twnxbp33gur4nwext9bzmm6mahjw44hr) the key and then import it manually.

You can then check that the key fingerprint is `7C56 89A0 383A 1228 2DCE 83D2 BA92 4E53 D0EB 3FCC`.

When the key expires, I will just upload a new one here. My threat model makes signing the new key with the old one completely useless and I will therefore not go through that hassle.
