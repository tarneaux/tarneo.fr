# PGP Key

To download my PGP key automatically with GnuPG:
```sh
gpg --locate-keys tarneo@tarneo.fr
```

You can also [download](/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/twnxbp33gur4nwext9bzmm6mahjw44hr) the key and then import it manually.

You can then check that the key fingerprint is `7C56 89A0 383A 1228 2DCE 83D2 BA92 4E53 D0EB 3FCC`.

When the key expires, I will just upload a new one here. My threat model makes signing the new key with the old one completely useless and I will therefore not go through that hassle.
