# Hello, I'm tarneo!

I am a high school student, but also a computer programmer, Free Software advocate and sysadmin at [Renn.es](https://renn.es), a 90s-style [tilde community](https://tildeverse.org). Some projects I made include [Shlonk](https://github.com/tarneaux/shlonk), a very simple URL shortener, and my split keyboard, the [Monkeyboard](/posts/split_keyboard/). You can also check out my GNU/Linux [dotfiles](https://github.com/tarneaux/.f) or my [wallpaper selection](https://github.com/tarneaux/wallpapers). If for some reason you want to see how this blog is made, you can see its [source code](https://github.com/tarneaux/tarneo.fr).

If you're here, you probably want to see my latest [posts](/posts/).

**Also me**:
