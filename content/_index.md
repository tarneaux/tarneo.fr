# Hello, I'm tarneo!

I am a college student and computer science enthusiast. Some projects I made include [Shlonk](https://github.com/tarneaux/shlonk), a very simple URL shortener, and my split keyboard, the [Monkeyboard](/posts/split_keyboard/). You can also check out my GNU/Linux [dotfiles](https://github.com/tarneaux/.f) or my [wallpaper selection](https://github.com/tarneaux/wallpapers). If for some reason you want to see how this blog is made, see its [repo](https://github.com/tarneaux/tarneo.fr). I am also an administrator of [renn.es](https://renn.es/), a 90s-style [tilde community](https://tildeverse.org).

If you're here, you probably want to see my latest [posts](/posts/).

**Also me**:
- **email**: tarneo@tarneo.fr
- **github**: [tarneaux](https://github.com/tarneaux)
- **matrix**: @tarneo:matrix.renn.es

Make sure to encrypt emails with my [PGP key](/tarneo.key).
