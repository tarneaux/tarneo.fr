# Hello, I'm tarneo!

I am a college student and computer science enthusiast. I just make any project that can be useful to me, like [boamc](https://github.com/boa-mc) or my split keyboard, the [supersplit](blog/split-keyboard).

**Also me**:
- **email**: tarneo@renn.es
- **github**: [tarneaux](https://github.com/tarneaux)

I am the administrator of [renn.es](https://renn.es), and this website is hosted there.
