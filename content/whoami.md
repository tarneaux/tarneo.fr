# whoami

I started programming in scratch in primary school (at the age of 9) and then, 2 years later, started programming in Python, which has been my go-to programming language for a few years. I have then started using other languages, first HTML and CSS (which, actually, aren't actual programming languages), then Arduino, C, C++, Javascript, and some others I have not done so much with like go. I also use Lua wherever I can for configuration files (NeoVim, AwesomeWM), and bash for all of my scripting. For more complicated projects I now prioritize rust for its great developer experience. I have also done some things with Docker for my server (see [our homepage](/)).

I am in high school in Paris and make little projects that, most of the time, are just for my personal use.

Most of my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/tarneaux" target="_blank">github</a>.

One project I really enjoyed making is my split keyboard, the [supersplit](/~tarneo/blog/split-keyboard).
