# whoami

I started programming with MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) in primary school at the age of 9. Two years later I switched to Python, which was my go-to programming language for a few years. I then started using other languages: HTML and CSS, Arduino C, C itself, Javascript, and Go. I write configuration files in Lua wherever I can (NeoVim, AwesomeWM), and I do my scripting with Bash. I now use Rust for more complicated projects, mainly because of its great developer experience.

I am the administrator of [Renn.es](https://renn.es) and every service there runs inside a Docker container.

I am in high school in Paris and make little projects that, most of the time, are just for my personal use.

Most of my projects are on [my github](https://github.com/tarneaux) and/or on the [renn.es git server](https://git.renn.es/). One I really enjoyed making is my split keyboard, the [monkeyboard](/posts/split_keyboard).

> I use arch BTW

I use Arch Linux as my daily driver and I don't plan to go back to windows anytime soon. I just think Free Software is the only way to get good programs that are designed for the best user experience instead of just making money. I managed to get rid of most of the proprietary software I once used: I will never regret doing that and I do think you should too.

I think one could sum up my thoughts on proprietary software with this quote from John Maynard Keynes:

> Capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work together for the benefit of all.

I also like to use programs which adhere to the Unix philosophy, namely: do one thing and do it well. This is why I do not use things like Nextcloud or an office suite.

I believe everyone should have the right to not be tracked or have their data sold to third parties without their ACTUAL consent (which I'd hope nobody would be dumb enough to give). If you think "I have nothing to hide", check out Glenn Greenwald's Ted Talk ["Why Privacy Matters"](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk). For this matter I also recommend you read [the Wikipedia article about mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance).

I don't like most of "social" media platforms: Instagram or TikTok, in my very humble opinion, do not provide any value to the user. I am also not a user of any google service apart from YouTube, which I always access through NewPipe or mpv(1).
