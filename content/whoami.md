# whoami

I started programming in scratch in primary school (at the age of 9) and then, 2 years later, started programming in Python, which has been my go-to programming language for a few years. I have then started using other languages, first HTML and CSS (which, actually, aren't actual programming languages), then Arduino, C, C++, Javascript, and some others I have not done so much with like go. I also use Lua wherever I can for configuration files (NeoVim, AwesomeWM), and bash for all of my scripting. For more complicated projects I now prioritize rust for its great developer experience. I have also done some things with Docker for [renn.es](https://renn.es), which I am the administrator of.

I am in high school in Paris and make little projects that, most of the time, are just for my personal use.

Most of my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/tarneaux" target="_blank">github</a> and/or on the [renn.es git server](https://git.renn.es/). One I really enjoyed making is my split keyboard, the [monkeyboard](/posts/split_keyboard).

> I use arch BTW

I use Arch Linux as my daily driver and I don't plan to go back to windows anytime soon.
I also don't like most of "social" media, especially TikTok and Instagram, which in my very humble opinion do not provide any value to the user whatsoever. I am also not a user of any google service apart from YouTube, which I access through NewPipe or mpv(1).
Basically if something is not free and open source software, there is a very low chance that I will use it, and if I do, it will be through an open-source third party service.
I think we can sum up my thoughts on proprietary software with this quote from John Maynard Keynes:

> Capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work together for the benefit of all.

I also like to use programs which adhere to the Unix philosophy, namely: do one thing and do it well. This is why I do not use things like Nextcloud or an office suite.

I also believe everyone should have the right to not be tracked or have their data sold to third parties without their ACTUAL consent (which I'd hope nobody would be dumb enough to give). If you think "I have nothing to hide", check out Glenn Greenwald's Ted talk ["why privacy matters"](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk). For this matter I also recommend you read the [Wikipedia article about mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance).
