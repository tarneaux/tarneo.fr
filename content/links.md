These are some sites, webpages, talks, etc. I found interesting.

## Blogs

All of the people of whom I list the blog here have one thing in common: they can get you interested in a subject you initially don't care about just by writing about it.

This section is sorted alphabetically.

## Articles / wikis / papers / fun stuff

[Index 1,600,000,000 Keys with Automata and Rust](https://blog.burntsushi.net/transducers/): A great article from Andrew Gallant, the developer of [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), about "using finite state machines as a data structure, which enable storing a large number of keys in a small amount of space while remaining easily searchable."

Paul Ford - [I had a couple drinks and woke up with 1,000 nerds](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf): how the tildeverse started

[SDF Tutorials](https://sdf.org/?tutorials): emails, website hosting and much more

[All escape sequences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doy/runes/master/doc/all-escapes.txt) (okay, this one is just funny)

[Internet statistics](https://www.mit.edu/~mkgray/net/) (written in 1996)

> "Here is what you do:
> - Visit an article, blog post, or Russian-hosted text-file e-book site that you'd like to read.
> - Click at the beginning of the headline, scroll to the bottom without clicking, and shift-click the end.
> - Command-C.
> - Paste into Your Friend the Text Editor.
> - Print. Keep the lovely Monospace font. Print 4 pages per sheet, so it is small enough but still big enough.
> - Fold your pages up. Take them to the park. Take them to work. Scribble all over everything. Make notes. Plan tweets about notes.
> - Find your pages years later, under the desk. Wonder how you could have ever been so wrong, so very wrong."

> I believe Google Adwords killed the web. Google Adwords incentivized sites to peddle SEO optimized garbage. Sites who aren't are forced to optimize for email capture so they can market directly to you. Search results now show "news", ads, and SEO spam instead of surfacing information.
