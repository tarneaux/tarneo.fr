> "Alpine Linux is one of the best distributions available. If you disagree, you clearly haven't achieved galaxy-brain levels of intelligence and I feel sorry for you."
>
> "The web is not the same medium as graphic design. Digital designers often get this confused. Web applications serve an action or purpose. The user wants to complete a task - not look at a pretty poster. I understand this sounds harsh, but many designers design more for their own ego and portfolio rather than the end-user. That extra flair on your lowercase "t" doesn't help the user better interact with your features or UI. It just slows them down."

[Tom Escolano](http://tomescolano.fr/blog/) (french)

[nerdypepper](https://peppe.rs): I love how minimal this site looks. If you are into split keyboards like me (and maybe also otherwise), you'll *have* to check out his post [programming on 34 keys](https://peppe.rs/posts/programming_on_34_keys/).

[Giles Orr](https://www.gilesorr.com/): window managers, Bash prompts, Vim, Raspberry Pis...

[Martin Tournoij / arp242](https://www.arp242.net/): Vim, software freedom

[Icyphox](https://icyphox.sh): made Legit (one of the easiest Git frontends to host).

[Liam Heinicke](https://heinicke.xyz/)

[ari-web](https://blog.ari-web.xyz/) (Want to see the matrix? See [this page](https://ari-web.xyz/page/novpn#!).)

[Marcel Patzwahl](https://snow-dev.com/) ~> [setup pass on multiple devices](https://snow-dev.com/posts/setup-pass-on-multiple-devices.html)

[Jake Gines](https://jakegines.in): another good example of a minimal site, although it's a bit hard to navigate. I don't think the best part of it is the blog, but rather the [notes](https://jakegines.in/notes) (a personal wiki), and an *enormous* list of [favourites](https://jakegines.in/favorites) (links). Also check out the [dots](https://github.com/JakeGinesin/dotfiles).

## Articles / wikis / fun stuff

[Index 1,600,000,000 Keys with Automata and Rust](https://blog.burntsushi.net/transducers/): A great article from Andrew Gallant, the developer of [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), about "using finite state machines as a data structure, which enable storing a large number of keys in a small amount of space while remaining easily searchable."

Paul Ford - [I had a couple drinks and woke up with 1,000 nerds](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf): how the tildeverse started

[SDF Tutorials](https://sdf.org/?tutorials): emails, website hosting and much more

[All escape sequences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doy/runes/master/doc/all-escapes.txt) (okay, this one is just funny)

[Internet statistics](https://www.mit.edu/~mkgray/net/) (written in 1996)

> "Here is what you do:
> - Visit an article, blog post, or Russian-hosted text-file e-book site that you'd like to read.
> - Click at the beginning of the headline, scroll to the bottom without clicking, and shift-click the end.
> - Command-C.
> - Paste into Your Friend the Text Editor.
> - Print. Keep the lovely Monospace font. Print 4 pages per sheet, so it is small enough but still big enough.
> - Fold your pages up. Take them to the park. Take them to work. Scribble all over everything. Make notes. Plan tweets about notes.
> - Find your pages years later, under the desk. Wonder how you could have ever been so wrong, so very wrong."

[xkcd 1205: is it worth the time?](https://xkcd.com/1205/)

[oldweb.today](https://oldweb.today/?browser=ns3-mac#https://tarneo.fr): browse the web with old browsers like NetScape

> I believe Google Adwords killed the web. Google Adwords incentivized sites to peddle SEO optimized garbage. Sites who aren't are forced to optimize for email capture so they can market directly to you. Search results now show "news", ads, and SEO spam instead of surfacing information.

[The Web We Lost](https://www.anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/)

[The Missing Semester Of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is one of the only places where [SSH port forwarding](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/#port-forwarding) is explained well. The first google result for this is cryptic.
