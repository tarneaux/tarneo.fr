I'm tarneo, a high school student, computer programmer, president and sysadmin of [Renn.es](https://renn.es) and {privacy, right to repair, free software} advocate.

Here's some of what I do or have done:

- I manage [Renn.es](https://renn.es), a french 1901-law nonprofit providing online services based on free software, including e-mail, Invidious, Nextcloud, and web hosting.
- I made two free and open source ergonomic split keyboards, the [Monkeyboard](/posts/split_keyboard/) and the [Triboard](/posts/triboard/).
- I am learning Rust by building various projects: For now I've made [Shlonk](https://github.com/tarneaux/shlonk) (a super bare bones URL shortener), and I'm still working on [Swec](https://github.com/tarneaux/swec) (an API for status pages).

Also check out my [NixOS configurations](https://github.com/tarneaux/nix), my [wallpaper selection](https://github.com/tarneaux/wallpapers), and this website's [source code](https://github.com/tarneaux/tarneo.fr).

Here are the programming languages I've used:

I use Linux (NixOS) as my daily driver OS and I don't plan to go back to windows anytime soon. I think free (as in freedom) software is the only way to get good programs that are designed for the best user experience instead of just making money. I managed to get rid of most of the proprietary software I once used: I will never regret doing that and I do think you should too.

I think one could sum up my thoughts on proprietary software with this quote from John Maynard Keynes:

> "Capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work together for the benefit of all."
>
> <cite>John Maynard Keynes</cite>

I also like to use programs which adhere to the Unix philosophy, namely: do one thing and do it well. This is why I do not use things like Nextcloud or an office suite apart from some special cases. I understand why most people don't do the same though :-)

I believe everyone should have a right to full privacy, both on the internet and in general. If you think "I have nothing to hide", check out Glenn Greenwald's Ted Talk ["Why Privacy Matters"](https://iv.renn.es/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk). For this matter I also recommend you read [the Wikipedia article about mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance).

> "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."
>
> <cite>Edward Snowden</cite>

I don't like most of "social" media platforms: Instagram or TikTok, in my very humble opinion, do not provide any value to the user. I am also not a user of any google service apart from YouTube, which I always access through NewPipe or Invidious. I believe [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) is a thing.

> "Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die. I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a "two sided market", where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them."
