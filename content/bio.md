I'm tarneo, an undergrad student and hacker. On the interwebs I'm known for my electronics, FOSS programming and overall computery nerdiness.

Here's a broad summary of what I do online:

- I manage [Renn.es](https://renn.es), a french 1901-law nonprofit providing online services based on free software, including e-mail, Invidious, Nextcloud, and web hosting.
- I made two free and open source ergonomic split keyboards, the oversized [Monkeyboard](/posts/split_keyboard/) and the tiny, mildly popular [Triboard](/posts/triboard/).
- I am learning Rust by building various projects: I've finished [Shlonk](https://github.com/tarneaux/shlonk) (a super bare bones URL shortener), and I'm still working on [Swec](https://github.com/tarneaux/swec) (an API for status pages) and [Qobuz.rs](https://github.com/tarneaux/qobuz.rs) (Rust bindings for the Qobuz music streaming API).

Also check out my [NixOS configurations](https://github.com/tarneaux/nix), my [wallpaper selection](https://github.com/tarneaux/wallpapers), and this website's [source code](https://github.com/tarneaux/tarneo.fr).

Here are the programming languages I've used:

Here are some of my opinions on tech:

I try to use as much free (as in freedom) software as I can. I think one could sum up my thoughts on proprietary software with this quote from John Maynard Keynes:

> "Capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work together for the benefit of all."
>
> <cite>John Maynard Keynes</cite>

I also like to use programs which adhere to the Unix philosophy, namely: do one thing and do it well. I understand why most people don't do the same though :-)

I stand as a firm defender of privacy, both on the internet and in general. If you think "I have nothing to hide", check out Glenn Greenwald's Ted Talk ["Why Privacy Matters"](https://iv.renn.es/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk). For this matter I also recommend you read [the Wikipedia article about mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance).

> "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."
>
> <cite>Edward Snowden</cite>

I don't like most of "social" media platforms: Instagram or TikTok, in my very humble opinion, do not provide any value to the user.

> "There are only two industries that call their customers 'users': illegal drugs and software."
>
> <cite>Edward Tufte</cite>

I am also not a user of any google service apart from YouTube, which I always access through NewPipe or Invidious. I believe [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) is a thing.

> "Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die. I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a "two sided market", where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them."
>
> <cite>Cory Doctorow</cite>

I also don't use "AI" (aka glorified linear algebra), because I think it is a socially, ecologically and economically completely nuts thing to do. If you don't understand this, read Kate Crawford's [Atlas of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_AI). I also think that AI is a bubble that is prone to pop one day, and you'd better not depend on it when it happens.
