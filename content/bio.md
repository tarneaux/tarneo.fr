I'm tarneo, a high school student, computer programmer, Free Software advocate and sysadmin at [Renn.es](https://renn.es), a shared GNU/Linux system in the style of the public access computers of the 90's. Some projects I made include [Shlonk](https://github.com/tarneaux/shlonk), a very simple URL shortener, and my two split keyboards, the [Monkeyboard](/posts/split_keyboard/) and the [Triboard](/posts/triboard/). You can also check out my GNU/Linux [dotfiles](https://github.com/tarneaux/.f) or my [wallpaper selection](https://github.com/tarneaux/wallpapers). If for some reason you want to see how this blog is built, go see its [source code](https://github.com/tarneaux/tarneo.fr).

I started programming with MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) in primary school at the age of 9 (my account was created on August 24, 2016). Two years later I switched to Python, which was my go-to programming language for a few years. I then started using other languages: HTML and CSS, Arduino C, C itself, Javascript, and Go. I write configuration files in Lua wherever I can (NeoVim, AwesomeWM), and I do my scripting with Bash. These days I write most of my software in Rust, mainly because of its great developer experience.

> "I use arch BTW"

I use Arch Linux as my daily driver OS and I don't plan to go back to windows anytime soon. I just think Free Software is the only way to get good programs that are designed for the best user experience instead of just making money. I managed to get rid of most of the proprietary software I once used: I will never regret doing that and I do think you should too.

I think one could sum up my thoughts on proprietary software with this quote from John Maynard Keynes:

> "Capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work together for the benefit of all."
>
> <cite>John Maynard Keynes</cite>

I also like to use programs which adhere to the Unix philosophy, namely: do one thing and do it well. This is why I do not use things like Nextcloud or an office suite.

I believe everyone should have a right to extensive privacy, both on the internet and in general. If you think "I have nothing to hide", check out Glenn Greenwald's Ted Talk ["Why Privacy Matters"](https://iv.renn.es/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk). For this matter I also recommend you read [the Wikipedia article about mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance).

> "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."

> <cite>Edward Snowden</cite>

I don't like most of "social" media platforms: Instagram or TikTok, in my very humble opinion, do not provide any value to the user. I am also not a user of any google service apart from YouTube, which I always access through NewPipe or Invidious.
