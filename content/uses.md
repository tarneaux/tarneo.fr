## Software

On my PC(s):
- Editor: [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for everything: code, text, this website, and so on. I even make presentations in Markdown and convert them to HTML using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md).
- Web browser: [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/), mainly because of its Vim-like keybindings.
- Youtube players: My own [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) instance on PC's and [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) for Android.
- Mobile web browser: [Iceraven](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser). This is the best browser for android because it is the only one that is decent. Its features include:
    - ACTUALLY not tracking you, at least according to my research.
    - Extension support: I use UBlock Origin, Decentraleyes, Privacy Badger and CanvasBlocker.
    - An address bar on the bottom of the screen
- Search engine: [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/) ([find an instance](https://searx.space/)), a "meta search engine". I enabled Google, Duckduckgo and Qwant.
- Audio editor: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
- Video editor: [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/).
- Photo viewer: [nsxiv](https://codeberg.org/nsxiv/nsxiv) with [a decent key handler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tarneaux/.f/master/nsxiv/.config/nsxiv/exec/key-handler).
- Photo organizer: [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/).
- RAW photo editor: [RawTherapee](http://rawtherapee.com/).
- Terminal emulator: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).
- Linux distribution: Arch Linux.
- Password manager: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
- "Smart"phone OS: [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) to get away from Google's crap on Android.
- Email client: [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) on PC and [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/) for Android.
- Mobile navigation/maps: [Organic maps](https://organicmaps.app/).
- Terminal multiplexer: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

On [my servers](https://renn.es):
- NeoVim & Tmux just like on my PC, with a lighter config for NeoVim.
- Linux distribution: Debian Linux.
- Backups: [btrbk](https://digint.ch/btrbk/) with btrfs, plus a custom backup script for off site backups.

For a few of those pieces of software, you can find my config files on [the Renn.es Gitea instance](https://git.renn.es/tarneo/.f) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/tarneaux/.f).

## Hardware

I use a Dell Optiplex 7010 as my desktop computer and a generic Asus laptop.

My mouse is the MX master 3 and my keyboard is my [Triboard](/posts/triboard/). They are both great, especially since I made one of the two `:-)`.

I use a second-hand LG Ultrawide 34" monitor. This is just incredibly useful, and makes using a secondary screen obsolete. The resolution, at 2560x1080, is not the best for the size, but I got used to seeing the individual pixels (especially since I have very good eyes), and it's part of this screen's charm.

My camera is a Lumix GX80, which is quite nice. There isn't too much grain up to 1600 ISO (which is far enough for me as I mostly take photographs during daytime) and it's quite small and fits my hand well.

My PC (USB) headset is the Logitech G pro X wireless. The range is average, but most of all, it's very soft on the ears. The sound is good, but it still sounds far better on speakers. I also use a Philips Bluetooth headset for my phone.

My phone is the Samsung Galaxy S9. It does the job no problem even though it's a few years old (LineageOS certainly helps).

For electronics, I use various MCU's (Seeed XIAO's, Arduinos, RPi Pico W) and Raspberry Pi's. I also use an overpowered 100W Weller soldering iron.
