## Software

On my PC(s):

- Editor: [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for everything: code, text, this website, and so on.
- Web browser: [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/), mainly because of its Vim-like keybindings.
- Youtube players: My own [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) instance on computers and [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) for Android.
- Mobile web browser: Firefox. I previously used its fork [Iceraven](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser) which has better privacy by default, but Iceraven can't be used with WebAuthn (security keys).
- Search engine: [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/). I enabled Google, Duckduckgo and Qwant.
- Audio editor: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
- Video editor: [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/).
- Photo viewer: [nsxiv](https://codeberg.org/nsxiv/nsxiv) with [a decent key handler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tarneaux/.f/master/nsxiv/.config/nsxiv/exec/key-handler).
- Photo organizer: [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/).
- RAW photo editor: [RawTherapee](http://rawtherapee.com/).
- Terminal emulator: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).
- Linux distribution: NixOS.
- Password manager: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
- "Smart"phone OS: [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) (degoogled Android).
- Email client: [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) on PC and [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/) for Android.
- Mobile navigation/maps: [Organic maps](https://organicmaps.app/).
- Terminal multiplexer: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).
- Git helper: [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).

On [my servers](https://renn.es):

- NeoVim & Tmux just like on my PC.
- Linux distributions: Debian Linux, NixOS.
- Backups: [btrbk](https://digint.ch/btrbk/), [restic](https://restic.net/) to Backblaze B2, tar to refurbished LTO-5 tape, rsync to another server.

For a few of those pieces of software, you can find my config files on [the Renn.es ForgeJo instance](https://git.renn.es/tarneo/.f) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/tarneaux/.f).

Nowadays, I configure both my servers and my dotfiles with Nix: see on [ForgeJo](https://git.renn.es/tarneo/nix) or [GitHub](https://github.com/tarneaux/nix)

## Hardware

My laptop is a Framework 13 inch Ryzen 5 AMD, with 16 GB of RAM. Works great, most of the concerns I had before don't really apply: I don't notice anything with the hinges (they're not noticeably wobbly) or the keyboard. The battery lasts for around 7 hours from 80% charge (with the smaller battery).

My mouse is the MX master 3 and my keyboard is my [Triboard](/posts/triboard/). They are both great, especially since I made one of the two :-).

I use a second-hand LG Ultrawide 34" monitor. This is just incredibly useful, and makes using a secondary screen obsolete. The resolution, at 2560x1080, is not the best for the size, but I got used to seeing the individual pixels (especially since I have very good eyes), and it's part of this screen's charm.

My camera is a Lumix GX80, which is quite nice. There isn't too much grain up to 1600 ISO (which is far enough for me as I mostly take photographs during daytime) and it's quite small and fits my hand well.

My PC (USB) headset is the Logitech G pro X wireless. The range is average, but most of all, it's very soft on the ears. The sound is good, but it still sounds far better on speakers. I also use a Philips Bluetooth headset for my phone.

My phone is the Samsung Galaxy S9. It does the job no problem even though it's a few years old (LineageOS certainly helps).

For electronics, I use various MCU's (Seeed XIAO's, Arduinos, RPi Pico W) and Raspberry Pi's. I also use an overpowered 100W Weller soldering iron.
